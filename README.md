# Cutie-pie-
I am Charity 
I am a beautiful lady
I grew up in the community called KwaThema
I'm a family of 3, but now I have a sister 
I'm an animal lover (pet life) 
I wanted to pursue vet life 
Unfortunately my matric result never met the APS score
I should be in University of Pretoria but in the end I will!
